4. Open Owner.sol in Remix. What does this contract do? Why would this be required?


What Does the Owner.sol Contract Do?
Assigns an Owner: When the contract is deployed, the person who deploys it becomes the owner. This is done automatically using msg.sender, which records the deployer’s address.

Restricts Access: It has a feature (modifier called onlyOwner) that ensures only the owner can use certain important functions. This stops others from messing with critical parts of the contract.

Transfers Ownership: The owner can also pass ownership to someone else if needed by calling a function to update the owner’s address.

Why Is This Important?
Access Control: The owner can control who can use important functions in the contract. This prevents random people from doing things like changing settings or withdrawing funds.

Security: It keeps sensitive functions safe by ensuring only the owner can access them, reducing the risk of unauthorized actions.

Flexibility: If needed, the owner can transfer control to someone else, allowing for smooth management over time.

Why You Need It
dApps (decentralized apps): Owners are needed to manage the setup and make important changes.
Token contracts: In cases like token sales, the owner needs to manage how tokens are distributed and handle the funds securely.
In simple terms, Owner.sol helps protect the contract by making sure only the owner has control over key actions and allows ownership to be passed if needed.
